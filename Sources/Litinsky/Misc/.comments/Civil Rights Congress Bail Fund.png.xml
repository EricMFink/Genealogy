In 1948, 12 members of the Communist Party of the U.S.A. were indicted under the Smith Act, which made it illegal to advocate the overthrow of any U.S. government. Eleven of the 12 defendants were tried in 1949, found guilty and sentenced to prison. The Civil Rights Congress Bail Fund organized a national campaign to raise the money needed to release the defendants on bail.</note>
